# Image Rendering in Book Renderer Tool

## Overview

The Book Renderer Tool now supports **actual image rendering** in the preview panel! Instead of showing text placeholders like `[IMAGE: filename.png]`, the tool now displays the actual images, making it much easier to visualize your book content.

## Features

### ‚ú® What's New
- **Real Image Display**: Actual images are rendered in the preview instead of text placeholders
- **Automatic Resizing**: Images are intelligently resized to fit the preview area while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Multiple Format Support**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP formats are supported
- **Smart Caching**: Images are cached to improve performance and prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when images are missing or can't be loaded

### üñºÔ∏è Image Types Supported

#### Cover Images
- Displayed larger (max 300x400 pixels)
- Centered in the preview
- JSON format: `{"type": "cover", "image": "cover.png"}`

#### Content Images
- Displayed smaller (max 400x300 pixels)
- Can include captions
- JSON format: `{"type": "image", "image": "photo.jpg", "caption": "Optional caption"}`

## Usage

### 1. Image File Placement
Place your image files in the same directory as your JSON file, or use relative paths:

```json
{
  "type": "cover",
  "image": "cover.png"
}
```

Or with subdirectories:
```json
{
  "type": "image", 
  "image": "images/chapter1/diagram.jpg",
  "caption": "System architecture diagram"
}
```

### 2. Supported Formats
- **PNG** - Best for graphics with transparency
- **JPEG/JPG** - Best for photographs
- **GIF** - Supports animation (first frame shown)
- **BMP** - Basic bitmap format

### 3. Image Resolution Guidelines
- **Cover images**: Recommended 600x800 pixels or similar book cover ratio
- **Content images**: Any reasonable resolution (will be auto-resized)
- **File size**: Keep under 5MB for best performance

## Example JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "type": "title",
    "content": "My Book with Images"
  },
  {
    "type": "author", 
    "content": "Author Name"
  },
  {
    "type": "cover",
    "image": "cover.png"
  },
  {
    "type": "chapter_header",
    "content": "1"
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "content": "This chapter includes a diagram:"
  },
  {
    "type": "image",
    "image": "diagram.jpg",
    "caption": "System overview diagram"
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "content": "Text continues after the image..."
  }
]
```

## Testing the Feature

1. **Open the Book Renderer Tool**: `python render_book.py`
2. **Load the sample**: Open `sample_book_with_images.json`
3. **View the preview**: The right panel should show actual images instead of placeholders

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Displaying
- ‚úÖ Check that the image file exists in the specified path
- ‚úÖ Verify the image format is supported (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP)
- ‚úÖ Ensure the image file isn't corrupted
- ‚úÖ Check file permissions

### Performance Issues
- üîÑ Use the "Refresh" button to clear the image cache
- üìè Consider resizing very large images before adding them
- üíæ Close and reopen the tool if memory usage becomes high

### Error Messages
- `[IMAGE: filename - NOT FOUND]`: File doesn't exist at the specified path
- `[IMAGE: filename - LOAD FAILED]`: File exists but couldn't be loaded (possibly corrupted or unsupported format)

## Technical Details

### Image Processing
- Images are automatically resized using high-quality Lanczos resampling
- Aspect ratios are preserved during resizing
- RGBA and palette images are converted to RGB for compatibility
- Images are cached to avoid reloading on each preview refresh

### Memory Management
- Image cache is automatically cleared when refreshing the preview
- PhotoImage objects are properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- Large images are resized before caching to reduce memory usage

## Dependencies

The image rendering feature requires:
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Already included in `requirements.txt`
- **tkinter** - Built into Python

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Image rotation and basic editing
- Support for SVG vector graphics
- Image compression options
- Batch image optimization
- Custom image sizing controls
